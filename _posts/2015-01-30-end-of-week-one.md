title: First Friday...
---

Well, it's the close of week one and we've been set loose on the first independent
(or thereabouts) project.  Rock, paper, scissors is still fairly proscribed, but it's a
good opportunity to practice setting up classes and using methods and attributes--and
passing information among various classes.

I think that what I've struggled with most in this project is keeping track of where
information exists and how I'm moving it around.  I think that if I'd come up with a model
at the beginning then it might be easier.  As it is, following a series of proscribed
changes to the structure of the program means that any model I might've come up with for
an earlier stage would've been next to worthless later on.  Still, it was a good illustration
of how modeling can be helpful throughout a project.  I also think that I'm struggling a
bit with scope.  It seems like I can resolve any issues that I run into via testing, but
it's still something that I have to step through very deliberately.

I think that if I were to teach programming to someone who were interested but completely
inexperienced, I would start with the command line and demonstrate variable assignment, data
types, and math and logic operations.  Then move into an executable and explain how to chain
those operations into a program.  Of the things that we've covered in class, I think that I
have a pretty good handle on storing information in arrays and hashes and how to access that
information elsewhere in the program.

Overall, the first week has gone really well!  I've really enjoyed meeting everyone and 
discussing the material.  It's definitely been an eye-opener to see how many ways there are
to solve any given problem.
