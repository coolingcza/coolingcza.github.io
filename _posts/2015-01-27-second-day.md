title: Second Day...
---

Well, another day, another dollar...or 'coding exercise' as the case may be.

Covered a few things today, including more OOP, documentation, and shortcuts.  Worked a bit more
on the Checksplitter program, which has evolved into the Dinner Club program.  Lots of testing and figuring out
how to access various bits of information.  Also, logic is still difficult.  Took forever to decide how to 
divide the functionality between classes in Dinner Club and I'm still not entirely happy with it.  But,
at least it works now.  Maybe I'll ask people to review it tomorrow.  Still to do: documentation.

Oyasumi...
