title: Gems and APIs
---

Well, I'm still pretty unclear about what each of these is, but I'll set out my impressions
so far.

Gems seem to be collections of Ruby methods and classes that extend existing functionality.
In the case of the marvelite gem, it includes definitions for classes as well, that might
be instantiated when making a call to Marvel's API...the class object is filled with the 
returned information.

'API' seems to be a broad term used for both accessing a database programmatically (like 
Marvel's) or a programmatic interface for certain functionality (like ENVI's).

The marvelite gem is a Ruby wrapper for the Marvel API, which allows us to write a
program in Ruby that accesses the stuff--whatever it is--in the Marvel API.
