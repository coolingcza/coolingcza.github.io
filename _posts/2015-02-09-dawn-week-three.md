What is "software development" as you understand it so far? What are the moving parts? Are those always the moving parts? Are they always called the same thing?

"Software development is the process of developing software through successive phases in an orderly way. This process includes not only the actual writing of code but also the preparation of requirements and objectives, the design of what is to be coded, and confirmation that what is developed has met objectives."

I needed to quote something.  My ideas were very big and turned into rambly sentences full of words that didn't mean anything.  So, see above.  Based on that definition, the moving parts (differences between projects) seem to be the developers and the requirements.  The developers might choose to meet the requirements using any of what seems like an infinite array of tools and languages.  I imagine that setting up a shared lexicon is one of the first steps in team based software development.
