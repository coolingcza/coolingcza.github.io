title: Day 1
---

The first day of Code School has been very interesting and very quick.  It certainly
doesn't seem like I've been sitting in class for eight hours, so hopefully that bodes well for the rest!

I learned a lot today and a significant part of it was coding or development
 language lexicon.  For instance, the argument that is passed into a method is 
 a parameter within the scope of the method body.

The terminal commands for navigation and file manipulation were a good review. I
hadn't touched most of those in a long time...hazard of working in a UI for so
long, I guess.

Git (and version control in general) was also new but sounds like it will be
a very important part of the development process.  I imagine it will make more
sense when I'm writing larger and/or more complex programs.

Signing off,
