title: A Day of Objects
---

We focused primarily on OOP today and while I had a working version of the homework program--
expanded CodeSplitter--I made some improvements and incorporated a new Person class.

First new thing today was to do more than instantiate class variables in a class' initialize
method.  For instance, my DiningClub class now generates the @member_list hash in the initialize
method.

I also broke out a lot of the functionality in event_go to separate methods--mostly for practice.
I then call those methods in event_go to change the same aspects of @members_list as before.

Covered a lot of testing today as well.  Minitest, setting up tests, etc.  Will need more practice,
but seems like it will be very useful.
