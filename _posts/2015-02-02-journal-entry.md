title: Working Remotely

"What was it like working remotely today? Did you miss seeing your classmates and instructors (If we may be so bold...) in person, and/or were interactions via Slack enjoyable in their own way? Was it hard to focus away from the school's space? Easier? How would you feel about working in a position where working remotely is the norm?"

There were some pros and cons to working remotely today.  I think that, had we been in class, this would have
been a pretty interactive day with code reviews and the new material that was introduced via video.  I think
that most of this probably would have been more efficient to do in person and that we probably would have
had better code reviews if we were speaking with each other and could build out ideas without needing to 
formalize them in writing.

The video presentation of lecture material was, honestly, pretty aggravating.  I think I would have prefered 
a list of reading material on the given subjects that I could parse for new information.

I did miss personal interaction a bit, but it wasn't necessarily harder to focus or get work done outside of the 
classroom/space.  I don't get much out of Slack, unfortunately...the lack of context for any given statement makes
determining its application more difficult and it seems like a pretty disorganized environment.

Otherwise, it was certainly enjoyable to be able to wear sweatpants and look out at the snow all day!  I think I'd
feel pretty comfortable working remotely though it may depend on how the company sets up informal communication systems,
such as Slack.
